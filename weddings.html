                    <p>
                        Good news for couples… No longer will you need to conjure up a last-minute excuse to explain why you forgot your wedding anniversary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We can offer you helpful reminders and comprehensive guides for every anniversary year – from the 1st to the forever.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether you want a small affair, a gala ceremony with catered reception, or a destination wedding, we have the expertise and industry contacts to either make your vision a reality or help you decide how best to celebrate your nuptials.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, we meet with you to understand what you would like and which aspects of the day are most important to you. If you have some ideas, but need help with other areas, we offer suggestions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It does not matter if you are envisioning a more spontaneous day or want something more choreographed/planned to the detail…we can accommodate your preferences. Maybe your vision does not fit within your financial reality; we can offer alternatives that
                        will still make the day special.
